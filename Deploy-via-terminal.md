Deploying Ultraviolet through a terminal is made easy.

## If you opened this repository in Replit:

- skip the [clone](#clone) step, start at [install](#install)
- use the Replit terminal instead of the console by selecting "Shell" under tools or selecting the "Shell" tab in the Replit terminal

## Clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/Ultraviolet-App.git
cd Ultraviolet-App
```

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

> If this takes long, you may attempt to omit dev dependencies:

```sh
npm install --omit=dev
```

## Start

Once dependencies are installed, select the "Run" button on Replit or run:

```sh
npm start
```

Alternatively, run on a port:

```sh
PORT=8000 npm start
```
